Death! Death to everything!

Enemies now have health! They have no death animation yet... but disappearing after a few hits is a start!

I also added health to the player. The player can take 10 (invisible) hits before dying a quick and abrupt death. The player ALSO lacks a death animation. As a placeholder, a pure red screen represents death. I've always said I'm a minimalist!
