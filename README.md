## Welcome to Cozy Cape!

Cozy Cape is a simple 2d wave-based survival shooter killer thing. I really don't know how I can explain it any better than that. Ya shoot things!

Question:  Why "Cozy Cape"?
Answer:    I have no idea...

Here's a screenshot!

## Features

I'll get to this eventually...

## Code Introduction

I've been meaning to write some sort of documentation as to how the codebase is structured, but everytime I do, things change and the documentation rots. Because of this, there are no up-to-date docs; you'll just have to pick a file and run with it (hint hint, main.cpp).

The included dev logs may be of some assistance. Good luck!

Here, have another screenshot :)
